# BreatheWell: Air Quality Detection Project
BreatheWell is an innovative project that utilizes computer vision to predict air quality based on images. With the power of the VGG16 model from TensorFlow, BreatheWell provides a user-friendly interface on Streamlit Cloud, allowing users to upload images for air quality predictions.
## Features
1.Air Quality Prediction: Upload an image, and let the VGG16 model analyze it to predict the air quality.
2.User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI on Streamlit Cloud for a seamless user experience.
3.Powered by TensorFlow: The project leverages the powerful VGG16 model for accurate predictions.

## How It Works
1.Upload Image: Users upload an image containing scenes indicative of air quality.
2.Prediction: The VGG16 model processes the image and predicts the air quality based on the learned features.
3.Display Results: Results are displayed on the user interface, providing insights into the air quality of the scene captured in the image.

## Dataset
